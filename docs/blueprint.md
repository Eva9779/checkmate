## Style Guidelines:

- The primary color is a confident, medium-saturated blue (#3399FF), chosen to evoke trust and clarity, making it ideal for key actions and branding elements. It offers excellent contrast on a light background.
- The background color is an extremely light, desaturated blue (#EEF6FF), creating a pristine and spacious canvas that prevents visual fatigue and highlights content.
- A dark, muted blue-green accent color (#2E4D4E) provides a sophisticated contrast for secondary text, subtle dividers, and non-primary interactive elements, anchoring the clean design.
- Both headlines and body text will use 'Inter', a contemporary grotesque sans-serif font known for its clarity, neutrality, and legibility across various screen sizes. This choice emphasizes a modern and objective aesthetic suitable for a financial tool.
- Use a set of clean, minimalist outline icons for actions and categories. Icons should be clear, consistent in weight, and directly relate to payment, product, and data management functions to enhance usability without clutter.
- Implement a clean, card-based layout with generous white space to ensure clear separation of content and an intuitive flow. Prioritize a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different device screen sizes, with key information presented prominently.
- Incorporate subtle, tasteful animations, such as smooth fades for content transitions, slight button presses on interaction, and understated loading indicators. These animations provide positive user feedback without distracting from critical financial operations.
